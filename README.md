#Election Analysis
##Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to assist Seth and Tom to produce the additional information requested by the election commission. The additional information requested consisted of the total number of votes casted, the list of candidates, the percentage of votes each candidate received, how many votes each candidate received and the winning candidate. This information was incorporated into the given script to generate the results, thus completing the audit.
##Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.
Please see the below photo of the Election results shown in the terminal. This photo will be used as a reference for the following points.

##Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
As seen in the above and the results this script can generate, there are a few modifications that can assist the election commission in looking at their data at different aspects. Therefore, for future elections I would suggest digging deeper into the data collected and showing more specific results. This includes the break down of how many votes each candidate receives from each county. Another modification can be executed with the addition of votes by state provided in the “election_results.csv”. We can break down the information further to see how popular each candidate is from each state.
